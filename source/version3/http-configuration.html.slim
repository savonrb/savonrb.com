title: HTTP configuration
---


markdown:
  Savon uses a simple adapter based on the [HTTPClient](https://github.com/nahi/httpclient) gem.
  You can get access to the HTTPClient instance to configure authentication and other details.

  ``` ruby
  client.http
  ```

  As Savon resolves imports on instantiation, this might not work for you. So if you need to
  configure the HTTP client for those imports or if you have any other especially complicated
  HTTP configurations, you can use your own adapter which only has to support three methods as
  illustrated by this [specification](https://github.com/savonrb/savon/blob/version3/spec/savon/httpclient_spec.rb).
  You can then globally change the adapter to use.

  ``` ruby
  MyAdapter = Savon.http_adapter
  ```

  or you can pass an instance of your adapter to Savon to only use it per-client.

  ``` ruby
  Savon.new(wsdl_url, MyAdapter.new)
  ```
