markdown:
  Savon version 3 is driven by major improvements to the WSDL parser. In contrast to previous versions,
  we now resolve WSDL and XML Schema imports, which means we can finally rely on these documents and
  use them to find better ways to assist you.


  ### Supported Ruby versions

  * MRI 1.9.2, 1.9.3 and 2.0
  * JRuby (1.8 and 1.9 mode)
  * Rubinius (1.8 and 1.9 mode)


  ### Summary of changes

  * Version 3 requires a valid WSDL document to work with. If you don't have a WSDL document,
    please continue using version 2. We're currently supporting Document/literal and RPC/literal
    style documents. Document/encoded is not WS-I compliant and rarely used. RPC/encoded is also
    not WS-I compliant and implements a whole new type system.

  * [Gyoku](https://github.com/savonrb/gyoku) and [Nori](https://github.com/savonrb/nori) will be
    replaced with a new type system based on XML Schema. This means both request and response Hashes
    will change to be more consistent and reliable. Don't worry though, Savon can create an example
    requests for you!

  * Support for extendable SOAP message headers is still a little rough, but will be improved before
    the official release to properly support WSSE authentication.

  * Instead of wrapping various HTTP options and then passing them to [HTTPI](https://github.com/savonrb/httpi),
    Savon now uses a very simple adapter class based on [HTTPClient](https://github.com/nahi/httpclient).
    You can change and extend the adapter to handle complex HTTP scenarios and use your favourite HTTP client.

  * Since we got rid of all those dependencies, it made sense to integrate [Wasabi](https://github.com/savonrb/wasabi)
    into Savon. This removes the need to coordinate features and releases between various projects all
    pointing to Savon and should allow for more frequent updates.
